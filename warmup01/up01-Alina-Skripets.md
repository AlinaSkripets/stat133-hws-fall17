To Die For Blueberry Muffins
----------------------------

### Recipe by: Colleen

> These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if you want!

-   1/2 cups all-purpose flour
-   3/4 cup white sugar
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   2 teaspoons baking powder
-   1/3 cup vegetable oil
-   1 egg 1/3 cup milk
-   1 cup fresh blueberries
-   1/2 cup white sugar
-   1/4 cup butter, cubed
-   1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

**No specialKitchen tools needed**

-   Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.

1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with muffin liners.
2.  Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, salt and baking powder. Place vegetable oil into a 1 cup measuring cup; add the egg and enough milk to fill the cup. Mix this with flour mixture. Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups right to the top, and sprinkle with crumb topping mixture.
3.  To Make Crumb Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Mix with fork, and sprinkle over muffins before baking.
4.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until done.

Quadratic Equation
==================

In algebra, **a quadratic equation** (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form

*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic.

To find the roots of the general quadratic equation:

$$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt {b^2-4ac} } {2a} $$
